These notebook files do not contain output in order to simplify version-controlling the files.</p>\n<p>The rendered Astropy-tutorials site is built using Sphinx with the Astropy theme to look like the main documentation. Sphinx requires restructured text (RST) files for its build process, so use an intermediate step to run the notebooks to produce output, and then convert the notebook files into RST files.</p>\n<p>We use <a href=\"https://circleci.com\">CircleCI</a> to do the Sphinx build, which is then pushed to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch of the repository and served by GitHub. The notebooks are first converted to RST files during the Sphinx build by doing the conversion at the end of the <a href=\"https://github.com/astropy/astropy-tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/conf.py\">Sphinx configuration file</a>.</p>\n<h2>Why not use nbsphinx?</h2>\n<p>Both running and converting the notebooks is handled automatically by the Sphinx plugin <code>nbsphinx</code>, but it doesn't support all of the features we want. In particular, there is no supported way to modify the template file that controls the output RST file that gets generated from each notebook; we want to be able to modify the template so we can add the links mentioned above.</p>\n<h2>Tutorials directory structure</h2>\n<p>The notebook files must be written as a single Jupyter notebook in a directory within the <code>tutorials/notebooks</code> directory. The name of the notebook must be the same as the subdirectory name. This is just needed for auto-generating links to the source notebooks from the generated RST pages.</p>\n<h2>Testing notebook execution</h2>\n<p>You can use the custom nbconvert script in the astropy-tutorials repository to test that the tutorials all execute correctly. From the top-level repository path:</p>\n<pre><code>python scripts/convert.py tutorials/notebooks -v --exec-only\n</code></pre>\n<p>Running the convert script with the flag <code>--exec-only</code> will just execute the notebooks and won't generate RST files. If you have already run the notebooks once, you may need to also specify the <code>-o</code> or <code>--overwrite</code> flag: by default, the script will only execute notebooks that haven't already been executed. The <code>-v</code> flag just tells the script to output more \"verbose\" messages, which you may or may not want.</p>\n<p>The above command will execute all notebooks in any subdirectory of the <code>tutorials/notebooks</code> path. If you want to just execute a single notebook, you can specify the path to a single notebook file, e.g.:</p>\n<pre><code>python scripts/convert.py tutorials/notebooks/coordinates/coordinates.ipynb -v --exec-only\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can also do this when running and generating RST files, which can be useful when writing a new tutorial to make sure it renders in RST properly. To do this, just remove the <code>--exec-only</code> flag:</p>\n<pre><code>python scripts/convert.py tutorials/notebooks/coordinates/coordinates.ipynb -v\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Building the tutorials page locally</h2>\n<p>For this, you can use the <a href=\"https://github.com/astropy/astropy-tutorials/blob/master/Makefile\">Makefile</a> at the top-level of the tutorials repository. From the root level of the cloned or downloaded repository:</p>\n<pre><code>make html\n</code></pre>\n<p>Will execute and convert the Jupyter notebooks to RST files, then do the Sphinx build. If this returns an error, you may need to initialize the <code>astropy_helpers</code> submodule (read the error message). That is, you may need to do:</p>\n<pre><code>git submodule init\ngit submodule update\nmake html\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once this is done, you will find the index for the pages in your local <code>build/html/index.html</code> file.</p>\n<p>For testing, you may want to run the build process on just one notebook file, as the full build takes some time to execute and convert all of the tutorial notebooks. To do this, you can set the <code>NBFILE</code> environment variable to specify the path to a notebook file relative to the <code>tutorials</code> path. For example, to run the build process on just the FITS-header tutorial:</p>\n<pre><code>$ NBFILE=notebooks/FITS-header/FITS-header.ipynb make html\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you use multiple environments to manage your python installation, you might be surprised to find that by default this build does <em>not</em> use the same python environment you are running sphinx in. This is because the <code>nbconvert</code> machinery depends on Jupyter kernels to create a separate environment to run each notebook. To use a specific environment, you will need to use the <code>jupyter kernelspec</code> or <code>ipykernel install</code> command to create a named kernel for your favored environment. Then pass it into sphinx using the <code>NBCONVERT_KERNEL</code> environment variable. Something like:</p>\n<pre><code>$ python -m ipykernel install --user --name astropy-tutorials --display-name \"Python (astropy-tutorials)\"\n$ NBCONVERT_KERNEL=astropy-tutorials make html\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Releases</h2>\n<p>We will release a new version of the tutorials with each major release of the Astropy core package; i.e. we will release for 3.0, 3.1, etc., but not for bugfix releases like 2.0.3, etc. With each release, we update the pinned versions of the global dependency files (<code>conda-envirionment.yml</code> for Anaconda and <code>pip-requirements.txt</code> for pip).</p>\n<p>To actually update the version, modify the <code>metadata.cfg</code> at the root of this repository with the new version. This is the version number that will be shown in the sphinx builds. Note that if it ends in <code>.dev</code>, this will be followed by a revision number that is determined by the number of git commits.</p>\n<h2>Marking a cell with an intentional error</h2>\n<p>Edit the cell metadata of the cell in which you would like to raise an exception and add the following to the top-level JSON: <code>\"tags\": [\"raises-exception\"]</code> This tag is recognized by the latest (master) version of nbconvert.</p>\n<h2>Automatically Strip Output and Notebook Metadata</h2>\n<p>Jupyter notebooks contain some metadata that is typically hidden from users, which contains, for example, information about the Python kernel used to run it, the version of IPython, etc. When tutorial authors or maintainers edit notebooks, this metadata is automatically modified by Jupyter, leading to superfluous and sometimes confusing changes to the notebooks when viewed in a \"diff\" locally or on GitHub.</p>\n<p>In order to prevent such metadata updates from appearing in pull requests, we therefore recommend that any contributor or maintainer install and use <a href=\"https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout\">nbstripout</a> set up with an automatic Git hook to clean metadata changes whenever a notebook change is committed to your local repo. To install <code>nbstripout</code>, first pip install it with:</p>\n<pre><code>pip install nbstripout\n</code></pre>\n<p>This repo is already configured. Next, configure Git within your local clone of astropy-tutorials to tell <code>nbstripout</code> to intervene whenever you commit changes in the repo. To do this, you first have to \"install\" it with:</p>\n<pre><code>nbstripout --install\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, to tell <code>nbstripout</code> to ignore metadata changes, you must also run:</p>\n<pre><code>git config filter.nbstripout.extrakeys '\n    metadata.celltoolbar metadata.kernel_spec.display_name\n    metadata.kernel_spec.name metadata.language_info.codemirror_mode.version\n    metadata.language_info.pygments_lexer metadata.language_info.version\n    metadata.toc metadata.notify_time metadata.varInspector\n    cell.metadata.heading_collapsed cell.metadata.hidden\n    cell.metadata.code_folding cell.metadata.tags cell.metadata.init_cell'\n</code></pre>","frontmatter":{"slug":"/contributing/infrastructure","title":"About the Tutorials Infrastructure"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/contributing/infrastructure"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1026961441"]}
